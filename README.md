# Visual regression testing

Faster, more user friendly visual regression testing. Used to tell a developer which components on a website have been affected by code changes, and gives a developer more visibility over a website. Involves three steps:

* Create reference screenshots.
* Create test screenshots.
* Compare the two to check if the test screenshots have changed.

# Acceptance criteria

* Developer must be able to run the tests while developing to get instant feedback.
* Should be able to run 100 tests in under 5 seconds
* Needs an easy to use cli so tests can easily be accepted

# To Run

* npm install
* npm start
* npm run phantom
